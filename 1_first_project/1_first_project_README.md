# 1. First Project: Run & Hot Reload

Welcome to your first Flutter app! 🎉

## Step 1: Run the App
1. Open this project in your IDE (IntelliJ, VS Code, or Android Studio).
2. **In your terminal, make sure you are inside the `first_project` folder.**
   - You can navigate there by running:
     ```sh
     cd first_project
     ```
3. Run:
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```
3. Wait for the app to launch on your emulator or device.

## Step 2: Try Hot Reload
- Change something in `lib/main.dart` (e.g., the text or color).
- Save the file and press **'r'** in the terminal or click the **Hot Reload** button in your IDE.
- See your changes instantly!

## Step 3: Make It Yours
- Change the title or the counter text.
- Try changing the color of the floating action button.
