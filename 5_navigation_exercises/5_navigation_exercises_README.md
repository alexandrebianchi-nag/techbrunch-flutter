# Navigation Exercises

## 🧭 Goals:

# 5. Navigation Adventure: Move Between Screens

Let’s explore navigation in Flutter! 🧭

## How to Start
1. Open a terminal and navigate to this folder:
   ```sh
   cd 5_navigation_exercises/navigation_exercises
   ```
2. Run:
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```
3. The app will launch with a basic skeleton. Open `lib/main.dart` and follow the TODOs to complete the exercise!

## Exercise
Add a second screen and navigate between them.

### Step-by-Step
1. In `lib/main.dart`, replace the TODO with your navigation code.
2. Add a button on the main screen to navigate to the second screen using `Navigator.push`.
3. On the second screen, display a message and add a button to go back (`Navigator.pop`).
4. Add a text field on the first screen and pass its value to the second screen.

### Bonus Fun
- Try using named routes.
- Add a fun animation when navigating.
