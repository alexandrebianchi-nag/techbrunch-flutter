## üé® Goals:
- Add ThemeData
- Customize fonts and colors
- Try Google Fonts or dark mode toggle

# 6. Styling & Theming: Make It Shine!

Time to give your app some style! üé®

## How to Start
1. Open a terminal and navigate to this folder:
   ```sh
   cd 6_styling_exercises/styling_exercises
   ```
2. Run:
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```
3. The app will launch with a basic skeleton. Open `lib/main.dart` and follow the TODOs to complete the exercise!

## Exercise
Customize the look and feel of your app using themes and widget styling.

### Step-by-Step
1. In `lib/main.dart`, replace the TODOs with your theming and styling code.
2. Update the `ThemeData` in your `MaterialApp` to change the primary color and font.
3. Style a button and a text widget (change color, font size, etc.).
4. Try enabling dark mode by setting `themeMode: ThemeMode.dark` and customizing the `darkTheme`. Use a toggle button to switch between light and dark modes.

### Bonus Fun
- Add a custom font (see [Using Custom Fonts](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/fonts)).
- Style an input field or card.
- Animate a color or style change.
