# State Exercises

## ⚙️ Goals:

- Build a simple interactive counter or like button

# 4. State Management Mini-Game

Let’s play with state in Flutter! 🎮

## How to Start
1. Open a terminal and navigate to this folder:
   ```sh
   cd 4_state_exercises/state_exercises
   ```
2. Run:
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```
3. The app will launch with a basic skeleton. Open `lib/main.dart` and follow the TODOs to complete the exercise!

## Exercise
Practice state updates in Flutter by building interactive widgets.

### Step-by-Step
1. In `lib/main.dart`, replace the TODO with your stateful widget code.
2. Add a button (e.g., `ElevatedButton` or `IconButton`).
3. Display a counter or like icon that updates when pressed.
4. Add a reset button to set the counter back to zero.
5. Add a live-updating text field and display its value as you type.
6. Show a message when a certain number is reached (e.g., “You reached 10 likes!”).

### Bonus Fun
- Animate the button or counter when pressed.
